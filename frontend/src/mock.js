      description: "Leadership is not a solo act—it's a dance of intuition, timing, and connection. At Élevé, we explore the rhythms of modern leadership: when to lead, when to listen, when to step forward, and when to create space. It's about lifting others as you rise, embracing flow over force, and mastering the grace between structure and spontaneity.",
